## Notable Games ##

This list attempts to record a variety of NFL games that are unusual for some reason or are otherwise useful for testing NFLScoreBot.

It should not be considered remotely comprehensive.

### References ###

If a good general reference exists, I have yet to find it. However, for individual games, [NFL.com](http://nfl.com/) and [ESPN.com](http://espn.com/) boxscores are linked.

### Contributing ###

Pull requests are more than welcome. Please include references to the game on at least two different sites (preferably selected from the above sources), and include a link to the relevant NFLScoreBot summary if one exists.
